Hello Blowerians!

There's been an uptick in reported posts lately, for probably obvious reasons. We'd like to make a few points very clear.

1\. Criticism of any nation's actions is not considered racism by us.
2\. With that in mind, please be careful with your wording, and do not use general racial terms when talking about the actions of governments.
3\. We expect all \*public\* posts that appear on the Local feed to meet a fairly conservative PG-13 standard. This is not just "adult" content, but also violence/gore.
4\. When boosting content from others, please keep the above in mind and think about what you're amplifying.

Please note that point 3 especially doesn't mean you can't post things outside of that standard, but use content warnings, post followers-only, or preferably both when doing so.

You're pretty much all good right now, but we may tap this sign a little bit and then as we go along.

Please ask us questions any time if you're unsure about anything! Thanks!
